You Now Have Two Repos:

lr-wishart-all - Your full folder structure
lr-wishart - Just the wishart_processes folder (the one you wanted)


Going Forward - How to Push Updates:
When you make changes to your code:

Navigate to your folder (if not already there):

bash   cd "E:\OneDrive\Dropbox\LinearRationalWishart_Work\Code\ED\LinearRationalWishart\LinearRationalWishart_NewCode\wishart_processes"

Add and commit changes:

bash   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of what you changed"

Push to GitHub:

bash   git push
That's it! Your GitHub repo will stay up to date.

Tip: Before running git add ., close Visual Studio to avoid those permission errors with .vs files.
Congrats on getting everything set up! 🚀
